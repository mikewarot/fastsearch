# fastsearch
Implements a search algorithm I invented decades ago in 64 bit pascal

  I've done quite a bit of searching and can't seem to find this algorithm anywhere, so I went through the effort of recreating it in a modern environment. The use of the carry flag to exit the loop means that this has to be done in assembler, to the best of my knowledge.

I'll document it better once I get some sleep.

This is the MVP - Minimum Viable Product for showing the code

On my laptop, it searches though a gigabyte in 1.964 seconds
